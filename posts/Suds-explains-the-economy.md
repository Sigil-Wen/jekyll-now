title: Suds explains the economy
---

Market’s been in a 12 year upswing fueled by something known as quantitative easing. I’m guessing you don’t know what that is, so will explain. 

After the great financial crisis, the Fed (federal reserve) wanted to stimulate the economy. The way to do that is to get people to spend money. In the case of monetary policy, “people” are corporations and the way you get corporations and high net worth individuals to spend more is to make borrowing easier.

As the Fed, you make borrowing easier by lowering the interest rate (which is the “cost of capital” or how much it costs to service debt payments). Rich people and companies rarely sell assets, instead they leverage their existing assets and their company’s cash flows to take out loans to finance growth activities such as buying companies and hiring people.   
VCs all looked like geniuses because capital was free their portfolios got marked up on paper and life was good
Now everyone is down and companies are diluting or completely smashing their preference and liquidation stacks and the markets have “rerated” tech stocks
Growth doesn’t matter as much as profitability today.

When the cost of capital is 0, everyone will make all their investments borrowing money, and revenue in 2029 is the same as revenue tomorrow.
When interest rates rise, you need to focus on cash flow and profits.

So quantitative easing (known as QE) was supposed to be a short term few year thing that the federal reserve never turned off because rising markets meant politicians stayed in power and the president appoints the Fed chair and the senate confirms them.
Also; the Fed prints a ton of money every quarter as part of QE. When they print money, it causes inflation because there’s more cash available in the market. The way you counter inflating is by lowering interest rates. This worked for a while to get the Us economy kickstarted. Then, from around 2012 onward, we had another great tailwind that would have kept markets up and to the right without QE - the tech industry finally arrived.

However, tech was a “cute joke”until roughly 2016, so the Fed kept printing money and lowering rates. This allowed VCs to keep investing at really low caps (like low single digit millions) and IPOing in the tens of billions.

When the Fed prints money, they’ll give some of that to the banks to lend out, but they’ll also do things like buy mortgages (the Fed used to buy until end of last year, $30b worth of mortgages every quarter from banks, allowing for US housing market to continue to run on leverage and prices inflate because banks kept loaning out money.

The Fed did the same with public stocks, treasuries, bonds, basically every asset you can think of that was publicly traded and liquid, the Fed bought.
So QE comprised of printing money, lowering interest rates, and buying assets. For 10 years from 2009-2019, the market corrected every so often but stayed on a tear up and to the right. Not because most industries were creating value (most non tech cos just do stock buybacks and dividends to accrete value to investors and then sell to other Pe funds when they’re close to dead) but asset prices inflated like a motherfucker.

While the S&P 500 returns roughly 10%/yr, VCs returned 25% a year on average to LPs. More monster IPOs led to LPs allocating more money and starting in 2018 you had a massive run up. We were officially in bubble territory by March 2020.
Then COVID hit. Everything came to a stand still for exactly 1 month then the market bottomed out and tech ripped face because we transitioned to digital. 

Remember what I said earlier - cost of capital at 0 means that one dollar you generate today is the same as a dollar generated in 2029.

Also in 2020, congress passed the largest stimulus bill ever - $4t. We pumped trillions into the market, the Fed printed more, revenues hit all time highs across the board in 2020 and 2021 and deal activity went thru the roof with investors because LPs had seen so much wealth from Tech that they started allocating billions and trillions to tech.  
What happens when there’s trillions of dollars of UNDIFFERENTIATED capital chasing so few ideas and good companies and the market condition is such that if you will ever make money in your life, you are worth investing in? Companies like Vise and Stytch raise at 10,000x ARR and companies generating revenue raise at 100x multiples.
Where everything changed is when supply chain crisis happened. Despite the Fed keeping interest rates low, prices skyrocketed. Even starting pay in the south went to $15-$20/hr (doubled) and homes and cars and gas all increased significantly. When consumer “staples” inflate in price, you have inflation.

The job of the Fed is to reign in inflation when it gets too big. The way it does that is by raising interest rates, making it costly to borrow capital and slowing down economic spend/growth. 

Unfortunately, the interest rate set by the Fed is also the interest rate the US gov pays on its debt. The Fed can’t afford to raise interest rates more than a few basis points every quarter without causing the interest payments the gov pays on our deficit to go up.

But, the Fed had to act, otherwise inflation would’ve continued uncontrolled (by most estimates things are 50% costlier than it was 2 years ago). So the Fed started raising rates in December.
Public markets started crashing in November, public tech companies have been in a recession (down almost 60% on average) since 2021 Feb or so. 
Across the board everyone is crunched for cash
Netflix is down 70% in 3 months, Facebook is down 50%
All the SPACs that went public are worthless
And WORST OF ALL, all the startups that raised at $1b Val’s with 1M rev have no way of growing into their valuations without raising more money
So they’re all raising at down rounds
And they overhired and didn’t care about burn because everyone assumed capital would always be available, and for the most part they were right
But inflation caused by supply chain was fairly unpredictable and fucked everything over.
What was predictable was this would happen. We were due for a severe correction, and we have it now. Look at all your fav tech stocks. Everything is down. Even amazon is down 40% in a year
Twilio down 80%
Etc
So now that interest rates are raising, SaaS companies are coming back to historic multiples (7.5x rev)
14x earnings
Earnings = profits


We were in a massive bubble and it popped and everyone only cares about profitability now, not even revenue growth
Shopify, the hero of the pandemic is down from $1700 to $400
In a few months
Zoom is down from $500 to under $100
Winter is here
The tide went out and everyone in tech got caught swimming without their clothes on
VCs all looked like geniuses because capital was free their portfolios got marked up on paper and life was good
Now everyone is down and companies are diluting or completely smashing their preference and liquidation stacks and the markets have “rerated” tech stocks
Growth doesn’t matter as much as profitability today.

Screenshot from my yahoo finance just now (I don’t own any stocks but have a list of the best stocks to buy once market bottoms)
Everything is down 5%+
And they gone down like this everyday for months
Most companies have already lost 70% and can lose 70% of thst again
Tech is hemorrhaging talent from public cos and late stage startups because their stock options are worthless
Late stage cos have to cut workforce because they need to get tomprofitsbility
And so early stage startups preproduct are basically the only place left w alpha
They’re fairly untouched and people r still paying premiums because we’ve seen how big cos can get now
Easily 1b but generally $5b+
So there’s no difference between $40m val pre seed and $10m
It’s all a call option basically 
But everything series A and beyond is getting smashed like anlotherfucker
Life is hard and basically no one is going to be able to raise for 6 months
I THINK that I explained everything in an easy to understand way. Sorry for how long that was. I didn’t realize that you weren’t following this and it’s REALLY important that you know this stuff as a founder and CEO, so wanted to explain in depth for you so you understood.

No, recessions are caused by many things, rampant inflation being one of the potential drivers
Inflation was actually good for startups and all companies because higher revenue and allowed them to raise prices faster than inflation leading to record profit
	What’s bad for startups is the fed raising interest rates to combat inflation
	All of a sudden companies like Ramp and Brex and all your fav BNPL cos and companies buying other companies and investors and funds that were heavily levered across their balance sheet or existing assets or future cash flows had to overnight start paying more interest 
	Which increased cost of capital, lowering profits
	Also, because investors couldn’t borrow at 0% interest rate and invest in companies
	The value of one dollar in revenue today became more valuable than one dollar of revenue in 2025
	So investing on a multiple of forward projected revenues for EoY 2025 became less valuable
	And companies (starting w spacs) that had gone public or raised in “well eventually make money” got hammered
	Everyone only cares about revenue now. Technically this shouldn’t affect VC
	But VCs aren’t good investors
	They aren’t principled
	And they are highly useless
	I pretty much despise them
	Most founders do
	Because they are in the asset management game 
And they are highly useless

For 10 years marking up your existing investments at higher and higher rates and raising a new fund and getting rich off of management fees was the easy thing to do 
Now that LPs are unable to make their capital calls (When VCs raise funds, they “call” the capital every quarter from their LPs, so it’s just the LPs commitment that they’ll continue sending money. When markets tighten like this, LPs are liable to miss payments).
Markets tighten 
Fear of god struck into these dumbasses
Half your captable is in this boat
Almost all of mine is as well
Not that they’re missing capital calls
But they’re all idiots for the most part
So when they see their stock portfolio slamme
They slam on the breaks
